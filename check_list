NOTE :
                                    Thanks for sharing the code ‚Äî that‚Äôs a big chunk, so I‚Äôll give you a structured review of your IRC server as it stands. I‚Äôll split my thoughts into good parts, issues / risks, and next steps to improve.

                                ‚úÖ Good parts

                                Command coverage: You already have JOIN, KICK, INVITE, QUIT, error handling, and parts of registration. That‚Äôs a lot of core IRC logic in place.

                                Separation of logic: You‚Äôre pushing parsing (like parse_join_parameters, parse_kick_parameters) into dedicated helpers, which is good for clarity.

                                Checks implemented: You cover limits, invite-only, password, bans, and admin/operator logic. That‚Äôs robust.

                                Clean replies: You‚Äôre formatting replies mostly according to RFC numerics (401, 403, 421, etc.). That‚Äôs the right direction.

                                Dynamic memory cleanup: You‚Äôre actually removing empty channels, deleting them, and reassigning operators. Nice touch.

                                ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues / Risks

                                Global static vectors

                                std::vector<Channel*> Server::channels;
                                std::vector<Client*> Server::array_clients;


                                This makes state global-ish, which can complicate future scaling and unit testing. Keeping them as instance members of Server would be safer.

                                Memory leaks

                                You new Channel() but delete only when channel is empty. What about clients? Do you delete Client on disconnect?

                                Server::array_clients stores raw pointers, same risk.

                                Suggestion: switch to std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr.

                                String parsing = brittle

                                You parse JOIN, KICK, INVITE, QUIT by hand with while loops. This works but is error-prone.

                                Example: if a client sends multiple spaces or malformed params, you may dereference message[i] past bounds.

                                Suggestion: use std::istringstream or a custom tokenizer.

                                Error message consistency

                                Sometimes you use :localhost 4xx ..., sometimes just "ERR_USERONCHANNEL\r\n".

                                RFC requires consistent numeric replies. Clients will rely on that.

                                Operator/admin logic

                                is_client_admin only checks operator, but you treat admin_socket_fd separately. This could desync.

                                If admin leaves, you reassign, but you should broadcast MODE +o consistently.

                                Thread-safety

                                Not a big issue yet since you use poll() (single-threaded), but all those global vectors could be a race condition if you ever switch to threads.

                                Hardcoded port

                                "6667" is baked in setup(). But your subject requires ./ircserv <port> <password>. You‚Äôll need to pass this->port instead.

                                RFC compliance (JOIN masks, channel types)

                                You only support #channel syntax. RFC1459 also allows & (local), + (modeless). Might be ignored in your project, but be aware.

                                üöÄ Next steps to improve

                                Refactor ownership

                                Replace Channel* and Client* with std::unique_ptr<Channel> and std::unique_ptr<Client>.

                                That way, deletion is automatic when you erase from vectors.

                                Consistent error replies

                                Replace "ERR_..." strings with actual RFC numerics everywhere.

                                Robust parsing

                                Write a helper std::vector<std::string> tokenize(const std::string&, char delimiter = ' ');

                                Then your parsing code (parse_join_parameters, parse_kick_parameters) becomes cleaner and safer.

                                Command dispatch table

                                Instead of if/else if (cmd == "JOIN") ..., store function pointers in a map:

                                std::map<std::string, std::function<void(Client*, std::string&)>> commands;


                                This keeps register_cmd lean and makes it easy to add more commands.

                                Registration flow

                                Right now, PASS, NICK, USER handling looks incomplete. Make sure you enforce the full handshake before allowing JOIN.

                                Testing utilities

                                Your show_array_clients() and show_array_channels() are good debug helpers. Keep them, maybe guard with #ifdef DEBUG.

                                üëâ Overall:
                                You‚Äôre in good shape for ft_irc ‚Äî you‚Äôve got core JOIN/KICK/INVITE logic down and it‚Äôs fairly RFC-friendly. The biggest risks are memory leaks (raw pointers everywhere) and parsing fragility. If you lock those down and unify your error codes, you‚Äôll have a solid server.
